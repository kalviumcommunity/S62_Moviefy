I finished setting up of the basic **folder structure** and **dependency's** for Backend

I achieve this through the following Steps:

- Created a new project folders from `mkdir Frontend Backend`
- Changed directory through `cd Backend`
- Initialized the Backend through `npm init -y`
- Installed the required dependency through
  ```
  npm i express;
  npm i mongoose;
  npm i cors;
  npm i nodemon;
  ```
- Created a Source file **src** through `mkdir src` and CD into it through `cd src`
- Then created the following folders
  ```
  mkdir Config controllers Middlewares Routes;
  ```
