# Moviefy

## Milestone 1

### Project Overview

This is my ASAP project, where I create a website where people can leave a review on a movie, and people can find new movies of the same genre.

### Key Features

1. **Login**
2. **Sign Up**
3. **Posting Reviews**:
   - Add a review with:
     - An image (optional)
     - Tags for the genre of the movie
4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Search for movies based on genres

### Tech Stack

- **MERN**:
  - MongoDB
  - Express
  - React.js
  - Node.js

## Why This Project

As a movie enthusiast, I want to watch movies, but the problem I face is that I donâ€™t get proper reviews and cannot easily find movies of the genre I like.
