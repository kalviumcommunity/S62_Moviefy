# Moviefy

## Milestone 1

### Project Overview

Moviefy is my ASAP project aimed at creating a website where users can leave reviews on movies and discover new movies within the same genre. The platform enables users to share their thoughts on movies, as well as explore and find movies based on their preferred genres.

### Key Features

1. **Login**: Allows users to sign in and access personalized features.

2. **Sign Up**: New users can create an account to participate in movie reviews.

3. **Posting Reviews**:

   - Users can add movie reviews with an optional image.
   - Reviews can be tagged with relevant genres to help other users find similar movies.

4. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can search for movies by genre to discover new films that match their preferences.

### Tech Stack

- **MERN Stack**:

  - **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing user data, reviews, and movie information.

  - **Express**: Web framework for Node.js, used to build the backend API.

  - **React.js**: Frontend library for creating an interactive user interface.

  - **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend of the app.

## Why This Project

As a movie enthusiast, I often face difficulties finding accurate movie reviews and discovering films that fit my specific tastes. This project aims to address these challenges by offering a platform where users can share reviews and easily find movies by genre, improving the overall movie discovery experience.
